# Voting System using HyperledgerFabric
Voting System, A blockchain based web app that ensures complete anonymity and 100% result. A voting web app made with MERN stack and Hyperledger Fabric. A one of a kind voting system, making other voting systems obsolete. 

Weve used MERN stack as our main tech stack, incroporating MongoDB,ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS. A huge part of the project is based on javascript mainly because of the popular tech stack.Then for our blockchain we have used one of the most popualar framework for residing with our custom built blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric. Hyperledger Fabric allows to build architectural based application that has the use case of a private blockchain. Pak Voting System is on of the best examples and provides the best use case for using private blockchain.
